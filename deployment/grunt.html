title: Grunt Configuration
---

<p>The initial Gruntfile contains only minimal configuration to compile SCSS files with SASS and Compass along
with basic watch commands to trigger them. There are two initial build targets for the SCSS, code and staging:</p>

<pre>
          dev : { // Target
            options : { // Target options
              basePath: 'public/sites/all/themes/f1ux/',
              outputStyle: 'expanded',
              noLineComments: false,
              bundleExec: true
            }
          },
</pre>

<pre>
          staging : { // Target
            options : { // Target options
              basePath: 'public/sites/all/themes/f1ux/',
              outputStyle: 'compressed',
              noLineComments: true,
              force: true,
              bundleExec: true
            }
          },
        },
</pre>

<p>These make some sensible defaults as far as how Compass will handle the styles. For dev it will expand the output
and add comments to allow easier debugging. For staging it will compress the styles and remove comments. In both cases 
it will attempt to use bundler to pin the version of the appropriate gems. The appropriate target can be passed 
to Grunt via the flag <code>stage</code>. So to compile the SCSS with the staging configuration you would run 
<code>grunt --staging=stage</code>. Note that this defaults to dev, so just running <code>grunt</code> will use 
the dev target.</p>

<p>There is a simple-watch set up to monitor SCSS files. It is using grunt-simple-watch instead of grunt-watch due 
to issues with inotify through NFS. Simple watch uses polling instead of relying on the notifications, which makes 
it slightly less performant, but the difference has been nominal.</p>

<p>The paths to the location of the SCSS files will most likely need to be changed to point to the appropriate 
path.</p>
