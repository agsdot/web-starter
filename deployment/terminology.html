title: Terminology
---

<p>With both Grunt and Capistrano there's a fair amount of specific terminology used by the tool. While
it's beyond the scope of this documentation to talk through all of it, some of it will come up in the 
documentation for configuration options.</p>

<h3>Grunt terms</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>task</dt>
  <dd>Each Grunt plugin exposes one or more tasks that take options and are triggered from the grunt CLI, e.g. compass.
  Tasks can be created via the grunt.registerTask function that will run composite tasks, and the "default" task
  is required to be defined this way.</dd>
  <dt>target</dt>
  <dd>More specific options within a task, e.g. compass:dev. If a task is run then all targets within that task
  are run or they can be triggered specifically.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Capistrano terms</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>stage</dt>
  <dd>Defines what part of the software lifecycle you are deploying. In the Web Starter Kit there are three that are
  defined: dev, stage and production. It's assumed that each stage may live on different hosts with different file
  systems, etc. but the majority of the actions to deploy the application will remain the same. Each stage corresponds
  to a file in the config/deploy directory and defines variables that are used by the Rake tasks used by Capistrano. 
  The Web Starter Kit also makes some assumptions about the naming of environment specific configuration files, things 
  like .htaccess, robots.txt and settings.php for Drupal, assuming there are files in the repository that are namespaced 
  by the stage, e.g. settings.dev.php.</dd>
  <dt>role</dt>
  <dd>Defines categories of hosts where certain tasks are executed. For example, when deploying a Drupal application 
  to multiple servers it's unlikely you will need to run update hooks or apply stored configuration on each application server.
  So there may be multiple application servers that need to host the code, but only one db server that needs to apply
  the updates. Each stage defines the roles and hosts necessary for deployment.</dd>
