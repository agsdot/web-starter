title: Local Development Environments

<p>The Web Starter Kit comes with the ability to stand up a local development environment that 
closely mimics your production environment.</p>

<p>It's built on the following tools:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank">Puppet</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://librarian-puppet.com/" target="_blank">librarian-puppet</a>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Web Starter Kit uses Hiera to control the configuration for the virtual machine so you don't need 
to modify the underlying Puppet files. Updating which packages, services and settings are used is a simple matter 
of changing some YAML</p>

<p>The Web Starter Kit is based around the concept of separating configuration into Hosts, Platforms and Sites. 
Each holds a piece of the configuration that can be overridden by the following set, but they allow you to 
structure your configuration so that pieces are re-usable. For example, the configuration for the Drupal Platform 
includes:

<ul>
  <li>A webserver</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Drush</li>
  <li><a href="http://mailcatcher.me/" target="_blank">Mailcatcher</a></li>
  <li>The following PHP modules:
  <ul>
    <li>XML</li>
    <li>PDO</li>
    <li>MBString</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li>XDebug</li>
    <li>GD</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And some various configurations for PHP and MySQL</li>
</ul>

But what it doesn't specify is which webserver it requires or which version of PHP. Those are left to the Host 
to have the configuration for what services and versions it supports. This allows you to mix and match Hosts and 
Platforms without having to keep changing the settings.
