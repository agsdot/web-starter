<p>Occasionally some issues may occur that prevent you from loading the virtual machine. Below are some common 
issues that others have experienced.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>If the virtual machine does not boot up and you get a message saying there was a timeout, try launching the 
VM through the Virtualbox interface to get more detailed information.</p>

<h3>Macintosh machines</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you experience errors when sharing the folder over NFS you may need to enable File Sharing in System 
  Preferences -> Sharing</li>
  <li>If you receive an error about an invalid export you may need to manually delete /etc/exports file</li>
  <li>If you've updated to Mavericks and Virtualbox is no longer working, try the following command: 
    <code>sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart</code></li>
  <li>If you are prompted to enter your password when SSHing from the VM ensure your SSH private key is in 
  the keychain by running <code>ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> from your machine</li>
</ul>

<h3>Linux machines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you experience errors when sharing the folder over NFS you may need to install the appropriate NFS packages, 
  on Ubuntu you will need to run <code>sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Windows machines</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Virtualbox requires the Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) be enabled, if you receive 
  a message saying that the VM requires a 64 bit processor and you only have an i686 processor this may be the cause</li>
  <li>Virtualbox may trigger a Windows Firewall popup to allow ports to be shared</li>
  <li>if your ssh key information does not correctly forward, you can copy your ssh private key to ~/.ssh and chmod it 700</li>
</ul>
